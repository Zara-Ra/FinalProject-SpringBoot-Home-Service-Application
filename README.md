# FinalProject-SpringBoot-Home-Service-Application

⭕ This application is a spring boot RESTFull API.
Spring Data, Spring MVC and Spring Security( jwt) is used as well.

⭕ I have used JUnit to write a variety of tests using a TDD approach.

⭕ My database is PostgreSQL, and I used Postman to test the APIs.

⭕ I sort and filter data from the database using QuerydslPredicateExecutor.

⭕ Using bootstrap, I created an HTML/CSS webpage for payments that uses ajax to transmit user info to the backend.

To make sure the user is human and not a robot, I've created a servlet for captcha creation.

⭕ The flow of the home service application is as folow:

   ▪️Experts sign up and add their services.
   
   ▪️The expert's email is validated by delivering a one-time clickable link in an email.
  
   ▪️The administrator grants access after approving the expert. 
   
   ▪️Customers register and place orders( cleaning, gardening, moving, piping, electrical service, etc).
  
   ▪️The experts file an offer after observing relevant orders.
   
   ▪️The customer selects an offer and waits for the expert's arrival.
  
   ▪️The customer pays for the service and provides feedback.
